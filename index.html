    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile Football ("the App") is designed for football enthusiasts and offers interactive content, blog posts, video sharing, quizzes, and prediction games. This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal data we collect, how we use and store that data, and under what circumstances it may be shared with third parties. By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy.

    </p>
    <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>
      Any content you create—including blog posts, video uploads, comments, likes, and votes—is subject to a manual review process via our admin panel before it is made publicly available.
    </p>

      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third-party providers such as Firebase, to help deliver and maintain our services.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> In limited cases where data is shared with partners for service improvement purposes, and only after ensuring the data is handled securely.</li>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize the security of your personal information. Our App implements industry-standard encryption, access controls, and other security measures to protect your data. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
